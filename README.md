# Rental-Management-System-Project
"The system to be designed is to assist the rental manager to keep track of rental properties and lease agreements using a relational database for data and transaction management."
Tables were created using SQL. Transactions were implemented using PLSQL or SQL on a relational system, embedded in PHP.
